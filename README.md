# Covid-19-impacts-analysis-using-Python-and-Machine-Learning

First, creating a dummy dataset of Covid-19 cases and their impacts on different countries.

Next, visualizing the total cases and total deaths using a bar chart.

Calculating the correlation between different impact factors using Pearson correlation coefficient : 0.9879816683858101

Finally, using machine learning algorithms such as linear regression to predict the impact of Covid-19 on a particular country.
